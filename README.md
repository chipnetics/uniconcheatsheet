# Unicon Cheat Sheet

A quick single-file (compileable) cheat sheet for Unicon programming language for both newcomers, and to refresh my own mind as needed.  My intent is to highlight some of the unique features of Unicon, of which other languages have either not implemented - *or are just catching up to some 30-40 years later.*

# Unicon Discord

For those who stumble across this cheat sheet, the Unicon/Icon community could certainly do with more realtime discussions.  I have created a Discord community which anyone is welcome to join.  https://discord.gg/WyvzpaYu
